# 2305_ASE

Code for MATH2305 ASE report. Figures can be generated straight from the figure.m files corresponding to each figure in the report pdf; figure 5 is in the poincare subfolder.
Additionally, the list of lagrange points and stable initial conditions can be found, as was used by me in the report, by the find_lagrange_points and find_habitable_orbits files. All other files are ancillary files.
